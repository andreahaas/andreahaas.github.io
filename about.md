## Education & counselling experience

In private practice since 1999, I have been assisting individuals and couples to overcome their problems and to regain a fulfilling sex life. My degree in Psychology, Diploma in Sexual Health Counselling from the Australian Society of Sex Educators, Researchers and Therapists (ASSERT) and training in meditation and mindfulness allow me to offer a broad range of therapeutic methods and holistic interventions.

You will see for yourself what blockages prevent you from having the sex life you want. Your concerns are addressed from a psychological and energetic level where lasting changes can take place.
