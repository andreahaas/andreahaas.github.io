## Self Report Questionnaire

This is an obligation free service and is only available to sincere requests. Please provide accurate information and complete all questions honestly, otherwise I may not be able to get a clear picture of your present sexual problems and emotional well being.

Also, indicate the best time for me to contact you. This first conversation is not designed to fix your situation, but it gives you the opportunity to briefly speak about your issues and ask me any questions. I may then be able to point out therapeutic directions helpful for your particular situation.

## Booking information

#### When are appointments available?

I see clients on Wednesdays 12-8pm, Fridays 10-8pm & Saturdays 9-5pm.

#### What is the duration of a session?

Each appointment goes for 90 minutes.

#### How many appointments do I need?

The number of appointments is difficult to forecast, because it depends on the severity and the nature of the problem you are dealing with. People are uniquely individual, have diverse life experiences and are at different developmental stages. A therapy process that is tailored and adjusted to your individual needs is likely to achieve results quicker. Taking these considerations into account, some clients will resolve their issues in a short amount of sessions, while other clients chose to engage in therapy long-term.

#### What is the frequency of sessions?

Most clients have weekly or fortnightly appointments.

#### Do you do phone counselling or internet skype sessions?

Unfortunately, I do not offer phone or skype sessions.

For clients who live outside Sydney, interstate or come from overseas, sessions are offered in block format, usually, a series of appointments over a number of days to give maximum impact.

## Medicare & private health fund claims

Please note that you can only claim from one provider, either Medicare or your private health fund, **but** not from both.

### Medicare

I am a registered psychologist and Medicare provider. If you experience a sexual difficulty or other mental health problem, you are able to claim a portion of the fees of consultations from Medicare (up to 10 sessions).

You need to first make an appointment with your GP. Your medical practitioner can either prepare a simple referral or provide you with a Mental Health Care Treatment Plan for the particular mental health condition (i.e. sexual difficulty) you are suffering from.

You may give the name & details of the psychologist you wish to see to your GP.

You need to bring your doctor's referral and/or your Mental Health Treatment Plan to the first session with the psychologist to be able to claim the rebate of $84.80.

If you have any questions about obtaining a referral from your GP please email me on andrea@andreahaas.com or call me on 0425 218 022.

### Private health fund claims

If you have private health insurance, your may be able to claim part of the fee for your appointment with a psychologist, but please check with your fund first, as this depends on the type of cover.
