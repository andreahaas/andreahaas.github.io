## Self Report Questionnaire

This is an obligation-free service and is only available to sincere requests. Please provide accurate information and complete all questions honestly, otherwise, I may not be able to get a clear picture of your present sexual problems and emotional well-being.

Also, indicate the best time for me to contact you. This first conversation is not designed to fix your situation, but it allows you to briefly speak about your issues and ask me any questions. I may then be able to point out therapeutic directions helpful for your particular situation.

#### Thanks for sending the information

You will hear from me soon. If you have not received a reply within 24 hours please call me on my mobile {{ site.phone }} between 9 am–5 pm (EST, Australia), Mon–Sat.

Please be aware that confidentiality can be compromised when you send email requests due to security limitations on the internet. If you wish to remain anonymous and do not want to fill in the self-report form you are welcome to contact me by phone.

## Booking information

#### When are appointments available?

I see clients on Tuesdays 12-8 pm, Fridays 10-8 pm & Saturdays 9-6:30 pm.

#### What is the duration of a session?

Each appointment goes for 90 minutes.

#### How many appointments do I need?

The number of appointments is difficult to forecast because it depends on the severity and the nature of the problem you are dealing with. People are uniquely individual, have diverse life experiences and are at different developmental stages. A therapy process that is tailored and adjusted to your individual needs is likely to achieve results quickly. Taking these considerations into account, some clients will resolve their issues in a short amount of sessions, while other clients choose to engage in therapy long-term.

#### What is the frequency of sessions?

Most clients have weekly or fortnightly appointments.

#### Do you do phone counselling or online sessions?

Unfortunately, I do not offer phone or internet sessions.

For clients who live outside Sydney, interstate or come from overseas, sessions are offered in block format, usually, a series of appointments over several days to give maximum impact.

## Clinic location

> **Note:** You do not need a referral from your doctor but you need to contact me on {{ site.phone }} to make an appointment before you come to the clinic.

## Medicare & private health fund claims

Please note that you can only claim from one provider, either Medicare or your private health fund, **but** not from both.

### Medicare

I am a registered psychologist and Medicare provider. If you experience a sexual difficulty or other mental health problem, you can claim a portion of the fees of consultations from Medicare (up to 10 sessions).

You need to first make an appointment with your GP. Your medical practitioner can either prepare a simple referral or provide you with a Mental Health Care Treatment Plan for the particular mental health condition (i.e. sexual difficulty) you are suffering from.

You may give the name & details of the psychologist you wish to see to your GP.

You need to bring your doctor's referral and/or your Mental Health Treatment Plan to the first session with the psychologist to be able to claim the rebate of $93.35.

If you have any questions about obtaining a referral from your GP please email me on {{ site.email }} or call me on {{ site.phone }}.

### Private health fund claims

If you have private health insurance, you may be able to claim part of the fee for your appointment with a psychologist, but please check with your fund first, as this depends on the type of coverage.
